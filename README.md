Visualization (udacity project 5)


Summary

The chart compares left handed Vs Right handed baseball players who have similar Body Mass Index. For comparing I have used the Home Run as a metric.Baseball playes with higher Home Runs are typically famous & amognst the highest paid players.

Design 

I selected bar chart, because I have categorized the players on the basis of their BMI & Bar charts are best suited to depict categorical data.I have selected different colors to differentiate between normal & overweight players.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feedback 

Initially I had represented left & right handers using color encoding. But, I got the below feedback:-

The user had to switch his sight multiple times between the chart & the legend to understand if he is looking at left hander or right hander.So, the message conveyed was not very clear. Viewer initially thought I was showing performance between normal & overweight players.

So, I changed the chart, by showing BMI in color encoding & handedness in x axis.
